Xen blkfront and blkback
===============================================================================

Considering xen and guest might use different page size, both XEN_PAGE_SIZE and
PAGE_SIZE are introduced into pv drivers. The ring buffer size is counted based
on XEN_PAGE_SIZE. The element in blkif_request is blkif_request_segment and
each segment is of size XEN_PAGE_SIZE.

Blkfront talks to blkback via "struct blkif_request" and "struct
blkif_response" in ring buffers. When requests are sent to backend, they are
not reclaimed until backend acknowledges and pushes responses back. The pending
requests' info are cached in "struct blk_shadow shadow[BLK_MAX_RING_SIZE]" of
"struct blkfront_ring_info".

blkfront and blkback use grant copy only when the operation is write and
persistent is enabled.

As the new version of xen block driver is changed to mq, the queue_rq method of
mq is blkif_queue_rq().

While grants are always the same size as a xen page (i.e 4KB), a physical
segment is always the same size as a Linux page.
