Steps 1-4 above perform checks that may cause VM entry to fail. Such failures
occur in one of the following three ways:
一共可能有三种模式返回vm entry的错误:

1. Some of the checks in Section 27.1 may generate ordinary faults (for
example, an invalid-opcode exception).  Such faults are delivered normally.
通过普通的方式(比如general protection fault).
目前猜测造成exception的RIP就是vmresume. 写了一些代码验证也是这样.

2. Some of the checks in Section 27.1 and all the checks in Section 27.2 cause
control to pass to the instruction following the VM-entry instruction. The
failure is indicated by setting RFLAGS.ZF (if there is a current VMCS) or
RFLAGS.CF (if there is no current VMCS). If there is a current VMCS, an error
number indicating the cause of the failure is stored in the VM-instruction
error field. See Chapter 31 for the error numbers.
进行到下一条指令, 把ZF/CF置位. 设置VM-instruction error field.

3. The checks in Section 27.3 and Section 27.4 cause processor state to be
loaded from the host-state area of the VMCS (as would be done on a VM exit).
Information about the failure is stored in the VM-exit information fields.  See
Section 27.8 for details.
像是普通的vmexit一样退出. 设置VM-exit information field.
