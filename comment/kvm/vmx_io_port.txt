vmx and io port exits

In the Intel SDM, it is mentioned by "Table 24-6. Definitions of Primary
Processor-Based VM-Execution Controls" that there are two fields to control the
I/O access:

- Unconditional I/O exiting (bit 24)

This control determines whether executions of I/O instructions (IN,
INS/INSB/INSW/INSD, OUT, and OUTS/OUTSB/OUTSW/OUTSD) cause VM exits.

- Use I/O bitmaps (bit 25)

This control determines whether I/O bitmaps are used to restrict executions of
I/O instructions. For this control, "0" means "do not use I/O bitmaps" and "1"
means "use I/O bitmaps". If the I/O bitmaps are used, the setting of the
"unconditional I/O exiting" control is ignored.


About I/O bitmap:

The VM-execution control fields include the 64-bit physical addresses of I/O
bitmaps A and B (each of which are 4-KBytes in side). I/O bitmap A contains one
bit for each I/O port in the range 0000H through 7FFFH; I/O bitmap B contains
bits for ports in the range 8000H through FFFFH.

A logical processor uses these bitmaps if and only if the "use I/O bitmaps"
control is 1. If the bitmaps are used, execution of an I/O instruction causes a
VM exit if any bit in the I/O bitmaps corresponding to a port it accesses is 1.
If the bitmaps are used, their addresses much be 4-KByte aligned.



IN, INS/INSB/INSW/INSD, OUT, OUTS/OUTSB/OUTSW/OUTSD.

The behavior of each of these instructions is determined by the settings of the
"unconditional I/O exiting" and "use I/O bitmaps" VM-execution controls:

- If both controls are 0, the instruction executes normally.

- If the "unconditional I/O exiting" VM-execution control is 1 and the "use I/O
bitmaps" VM-execution control is 0, the instruction causes a VM exit.

- If the "use I/O bitmaps" VM-execution control is 1, the instruction causes a
VM exit if it attempts to access an IO port corresponding to a bit set to 1 in
the appropriate I/O bitmap. If an I/O operation "wraps around" the 16-bit
IO-port space (accesses ports FFFFH and 0000H), the I/O instruction causes a VM
exit.


#define CPU_BASED_UNCOND_IO_EXITING             VMCS_CONTROL_BIT(UNCOND_IO_EXITING)
#define CPU_BASED_USE_IO_BITMAPS                VMCS_CONTROL_BIT(USE_IO_BITMAPS)


From v5.13, the CPU_BASED_UNCOND_IO_EXITING is set in setup_vmcs_config().

The CPU_BASED_USE_IO_BITMAPS is not used for non-nested vmx.
