vmx and xsave.

根据manual的"Definitions of Secondary Processor-Based VM-Execution Controls",
bit 20 (Enable XSAVES/XRSTORS) 可以 "If this control is 0, any execution of
XSAVES or XRSTORS causes a #UD".

大概是, 如果设置了, 就不会#UD, 而是参考XSS-exiting bitmap.

- XRSTORS.

The XRSTORS instruction causes a VM exit if the "enable XSAVES/XRSTORS"
VM-execution control is 1 and any bit is set in the logical-AND of the
following three values: EDX:EAX, the IA32_XSS MSR, and the XSS-exiting bitmap.

- XSAVES.

The SAVES instruction causes a VM exit if the "enable XSAVES/XRSTORS"
VM-execution control is 1 and any bit is set in the logical-AND of the
following three values: EDX:EAX, the IA32_XSS MSR, and the XSS-exiting bitmap.


对于vmx, 初始化的时候在init_vmcs()会把vmcs中的XSS-exiting bitmap设置成全是0.

#define VMX_XSS_EXIT_BITMAP 0

vmcs_write64(XSS_EXIT_BITMAP, VMX_XSS_EXIT_BITMAP);


对于nested vmx是在prepare_vmcs02_rare()设置的.

vmcs_write64(XSS_EXIT_BITMAP, vmcs12->xss_exit_bitmap);


static inline bool cpu_has_vmx_xsaves(void)
{
    return vmcs_config.cpu_based_2nd_exec_ctrl &
           SECONDARY_EXEC_XSAVES;
}


#define SECONDARY_EXEC_XSAVES VMCS_CONTROL_BIT(XSAVES)

/* Secondary Processor-Based VM-Execution Controls, word 2 */
#define VMX_FEATURE_XSAVES              ( 2*32+ 20) /* "" Enable XSAVES and XRSTORS in guest */
