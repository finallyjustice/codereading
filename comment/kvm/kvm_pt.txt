Processor Trace can operate in one of three modes:

a. system-wide: trace both host/guest and output to host buffer
b. host-only:   only trace host and output to host buffer
c. host-guest:  trace host and guest simultaneously and output to their
                respective buffer

KVM currently only supports (a) and (c).
