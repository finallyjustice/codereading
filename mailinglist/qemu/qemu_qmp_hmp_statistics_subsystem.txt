This patchset adds QEMU support for querying fd-based KVM statistics.
This allows the user to analyze the behavior of the VM without access
to debugfs.

However, instead of adding an ad hoc command, the new QMP entry point
can be extended in the future to more statistics provider than KVM
(for example TCG, tap, or the block layer) and to more objects than
the VM and vCPUS (for example network interfaces or block devices).

Because the statistics exposed by KVM are not known at compile time,
the kernel interface also comes with an introspectable schema.  This
schema is exposed by the query-stats-schemas QMP command.
