Question about performance comparison between virtio-fs and virtio-blk

Hi Hao,

My impression in general is that virtio-blk is much faster than virtiofs.
A simple macro test is do a kernel compilation and compare time taken
between the two.

I had basically used fio jobs. I wrote some simple wrapper scripts to
run fio and parse and report numbers.

I don't have data for virtio-blk but I do seem to have some comparison
numbers of virtiofs and virtio-9p.
