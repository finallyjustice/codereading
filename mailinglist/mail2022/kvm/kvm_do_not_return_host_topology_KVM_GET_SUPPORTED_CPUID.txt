[PATCH v2] KVM: x86: Do not return host topology information from KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID

... from Paolo Bonzini <pbonzini@redhat.com> ...

Currently the cpuid may return the host CPU topology info to VM.

The below is added to the Documentation:

-----------------------
Several CPUID values include topology information for the host CPU: 0x0b and
0x1f for Intel systems, 0x8000001e for AMD systems.  Different versions of KVM
return different values for this information and userspace should not rely on
it.  Currently they return all zeroes.

If userspace wishes to set up a guest topology, it should be careful that the
values of these three leaves differ for each CPU.  In particular, the APIC ID
is found in EDX for all subleaves of 0x0b and 0x1f, and in EAX for 0x8000001e;
the latter also encodes the core id and node id in bits 7:0 of EBX and ECX
respectively.
-----------------------

Currently, the KVM:

(1) calls do_host_cpuid() to obtain the info form the host.
(2) edit the info and return to VM

The patch will zap all related values.

E.g., Zero all values.

 	case 0x8000001e:
+		/* Do not return host topology information.  */
+		entry->eax = entry->ebx = entry->ecx = 0;
+		entry->edx = 0; /* reserved */
 		break;
