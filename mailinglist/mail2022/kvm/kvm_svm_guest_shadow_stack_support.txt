[RFC PATCH 0/7] SVM guest shadow stack support

... from John Allen <john.allen@amd.com> ...

AMD Zen3 and newer processors support shadow stack, a feature designed to
protect against ROP (return-oriented programming) attacks in which an attacker
manipulates return addresses on the call stack in order to execute arbitrary
code. To prevent this, shadow stacks can be allocated that are only used by
control transfer and return instructions. When a CALL instruction is issued, it
writes the return address to both the program stack and the shadow stack. When
the subsequent RET instruction is issued, it pops the return address from both
stacks and compares them. If the addresses don't match, a control-protection
exception is raised.

Shadow stack and a related feature, Indirect Branch Tracking (IBT), are
collectively referred to as Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET). However,
current AMD processors only support shadow stack and not IBT.

This series adds support for shadow stack in SVM guests and builds upon the
support added in the CET guest support patch series [1] and the CET kernel
patch series [2]. Additional patches are required to support shadow stack
enabled guests in qemu [3] and glibc [4].

That is, this RFC patch set is on top of some un-merged patches.

The core ideas is to passthrough the MSRs to guest, and save/restore during
vcpu entry/exit.
