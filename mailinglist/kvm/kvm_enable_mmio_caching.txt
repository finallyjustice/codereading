[PATCH] KVM: x86/mmu: Use enable_mmio_caching to track if MMIO caching is enabled

感觉MMIO caching的名字有一些confusing. 更应该是MMIO fast.

其实就是用ept_misconfig完成MMIO更高效一些, 先用violation标记下, 这样以后用misconfig就处理了.

如果shadow_mmio_value里的某些bit被别的feature用了, 就要disable MMIO caching了, 比如:

/*
 * Disable MMIO caching if the MMIO value collides with the bits that
 * are used to hold the relocated GFN when the L1TF mitigation is
 * enabled.  This should never fire as there is no known hardware that
 * can trigger this condition, e.g. SME/SEV CPUs that require a custom
 * MMIO value are not susceptible to L1TF.
 */
From svm_adjust_mmio_mask():
/*
 * The default MMIO mask is a single bit (excluding the present bit),
 * which could conflict with the memory encryption bit. Check for
 * memory encryption support and override the default MMIO mask if
 * memory encryption is enabled.
 */
