Patch提出想把shrinker删掉, 但是Sean提出了不同的建议. 而且建议为KVM的shirnker加上SHRINKER_MEMCG_AWARE.

Nit, the TDP MMU doesn't use the shrinker, but legacy MMU, which supports TDP,
does.

Ah, but digging into this aspect reveals that per-memcg shrinkers were added in
2015 by commit cb731d6c62bb ("vmscan: per memory cgroup slab shrinkers").  I
haven't dug too deep, but presumably it wouldn't be all that difficult to support
SHRINKER_MEMCG_AWARE in KVM.  That's quite tempting to support as it would/could
guard against an unintentional DoS of sorts against L1 from L2, e.g. if L1 doesn't
cap the number of TDP SPTEs it creates (*cough* TDP MMU *cough*) and ends up
creating a large number of SPTEs for L2.  IIUC, that sort of scenario was the
primary motivation for commit 2de4085cccea ("KVM: x86/MMU: Recursively zap nested
TDP SPs when zapping last/only parent").

vmscan: per memory cgroup slab shrinkers

This patch adds SHRINKER_MEMCG_AWARE flag.  If a shrinker has this flag
set, it will be called per memory cgroup.  The memory cgroup to scan
objects from is passed in shrink_control->memcg.  If the memory cgroup
is NULL, a memcg aware shrinker is supposed to scan objects from the
global list.  Unaware shrinkers are only called on global pressure with
memcg=NULL.
