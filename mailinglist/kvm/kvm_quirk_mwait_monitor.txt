[PATCH 1/5] KVM: x86: Add a quirk for KVM's "MONITOR/MWAIT are NOPs!" behavior


核心思想是很多VM的操作系统不看cpuid是否支持就使用MONITOR/MWAIT.
patch之前对于mwait和monitor就是emulate nop.

patch之后就 ...

By default, KVM emulates MONITOR/MWAIT (if they are intercepted) as NOPs
regardless of whether or not MONITOR/MWAIT are supported according to guest
CPUID.  When this quirk is disabled and KVM_X86_DISABLE_EXITS_MWAIT is not set
(MONITOR/MWAIT are intercepted), KVM will inject a #UD on MONITOR/MWAIT if
they're unsupported per guest CPUID. Note, KVM will modify MONITOR/MWAIT
support in guest CPUID on writes to MISC_ENABLE if
KVM_X86_QUIRK_MISC_ENABLE_NO_MWAIT is disabled.


注意是下面的控制是否trap mwait和monitor.

CPU_BASED_MWAIT_EXITING
CPU_BASED_MONITOR_EXITING
