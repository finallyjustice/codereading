----------

The patchset is simple.

In the past, "-overcommit mem-lock=on" consumes lots of memory pages,
because it locks both current and future pages.

One of the reasons to enable mem-lock is to protect a QEMU process'
pages from being compacted and migrated by kcompactd (which does so
by messing with a live process page tables causing thousands of TLB
flush IPIs per second) basically stealing all guest time while it's
active.


The new "-overcommit mem-lock=on-fault" locks pages on demand and on fault.
