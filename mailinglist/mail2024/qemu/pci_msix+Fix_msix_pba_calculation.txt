Each byte has 8-bit.

Therefore, the start vector should be the current start byte times 8.

The end vector should be the last end byte times 8.

The current start byte: addr

The last end byte: (addr + size)

==========

Fortunately, it looks it won't impact a lot.

In addition, there is another patch in progress.
