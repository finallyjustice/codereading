[RFC PATCH v1 00/19] Factor out HVF's instruction emulator

https://lore.kernel.org/all/1740126987-8483-1-git-send-email-liuwe@linux.microsoft.com/

Microsoft's Linux Systems Group developed a Linux driver for the Microsoft
Hypervisor (MSHV for short). The driver is being upstreamed. The first
supported VMM is Cloud Hypervisor. QEMU will be the second supported VMM.

The plan is to write an mshv accelerator in QEMU. The accelerator is still in
the works.

MSHV doesn't emulate instructions. VMMs are supposed to bring their own
instruction emulator. The path we've chosen is to reuse what's already in QEMU.
The instruction emulator in HVF looks good for what we need.

This patch series attempts to make the instruction emulator in HVF a common
component for the i386 target. It removes HVF specific code by either using a
set of hooks or moving it to better locations. The new incoming MSHV
accelerator will implement the hooks, and where necessary, enhance the emulator
and / or add new hooks.


[PATCH v4 00/16] KVM: arm64: Add NV GICv3 support


[PATCH 0/3] KVM: SVM: Zero DEBUGCTL before VMRUN if necessary

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250224181315.2376869-1-seanjc@google.com/

BusLockTrap is controlled through DEBUGCTL MSR and currently DEBUGCTL MSR is
saved/restored on guest entry/exit only if LBRV is enabled. So, if BusLockTrap
is enabled on the host, it will remain enabled even after guest entry and thus,
if some process inside the guest causes a BusLock, KVM will inject #DB from
host to the guest.
