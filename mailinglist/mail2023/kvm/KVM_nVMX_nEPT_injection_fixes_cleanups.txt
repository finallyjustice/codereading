--------------------------

The core idea is: KVM doesn't clear EXIT_QUALIFICATION when injecting an EPT
Misconfig into L1.

--------------------------

[PATCH 1/3] KVM: nVMX: Clear EXIT_QUALIFICATION when injecting an EPT Misconfig

The below is from the SDM. The EXIT_QUALIFICATION is only saved for ept
violation, NOT misconfig.

  This field is saved for VM exits due to the following causes:
  debug exceptions; page-fault exceptions; start-up IPIs (SIPIs);
  system-management interrupts (SMIs) that arrive immediately after the
  execution of I/O instructions; task switches; INVEPT; INVLPG; INVPCID;
  INVVPID; LGDT; LIDT; LLDT; LTR; SGDT; SIDT; SLDT; STR; VMCLEAR; VMPTRLD;
  VMPTRST; VMREAD; VMWRITE; VMXON; WBINVD; WBNOINVD; XRSTORS; XSAVES;
  control-register accesses; MOV DR; I/O instructions; MWAIT; accesses to
  the APIC-access page; EPT violations; EOI virtualization; APIC-write
  emulation; page-modification log full; SPP-related events; and
  instruction timeout. For all other VM exits, this field is cleared.


Always set qualification to 0 in nested_ept_inject_page_fault().

--------------------------

[PATCH 2/3] KVM: x86: Move nEPT exit_qualification field from kvm_vcpu_arch to x86_exception

We use arch.exit_qualification (arch!!!) only for ept violation.

The below is from the comment in kvm_vcpu_arch. The field is only for ept.

1254         /* set at EPT violation at this point */
1255         unsigned long exit_qualification;


Move it to x86_exception.

struct guest_walker
-> struct x86_exception fault

struct x86_exception {
    u8 vector;
    bool error_code_valid;
    u16 error_code;
    bool nested_page_fault;
    u64 address; /* cr2 or nested page fault gpa */
    u8 async_page_fault;
};

--------------------------

[PATCH 3/3] KVM: nVMX: Add a sanity check that nested PML Full stems from EPT Violations

Add a check to make sure the field is only for ept violation.
