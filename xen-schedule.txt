Xen Schedulers
===============================================================================

When the xen hypervisor initializes, it creates an idle_domain, the total vcpu
number of which is the same as physical cpu. Each vcpu of idle_domain
corresponds to a physical cpu to run idle loops. The vcpu of idle_domain has
the lowest priority.

The function schedule() is registered as softirq handler for SCHEDULE_SOFTIRQ
in  __start_xen() => init_idle_domain() => scheduler_init(). The xen hypervisor
also registers a s_timer_fn for each physical cpu in scheduler_init() =>
cpu_schedule_up().

Every time when s_timer_fn is triggered, SCHEDULE_SOFTIRQ would be raised.
idle_loop() => do_softirq() would later process this softirq.
